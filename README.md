# GTAV/FIVEM external triggerbot

Very simple GTAV trigger bot for default crosshair
- Undetected
- Completely external

  The script checks the color of the pixel in the middle of the screen while you hold down rightclick.

  If an enemy NPC/player walks in front of it, the color changes to a dark red, which the script detects, and then sends clicks in random bursts.

  Reaction time: 25-35ms average.  This delay makes it less viable on fivem due to the bad sync of the game and additional ping

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
